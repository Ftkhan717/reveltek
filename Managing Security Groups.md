Summary
Dream Quest: Users have an A1 account and are part of the Dream Quest security group. They are considered "dreamers" and are in the learning phase.
RevelTek: Once users pass the interview and are accepted into the formal internship, they are moved to the RevelTek security group and given an A3 account.
World Enterprise: If users perform well and start reporting directly to an American client, they are moved to the World Enterprise security group for an advanced internship.
By following these steps, you can ensure that users are correctly transitioned between security groups and their licenses are updated accordingly. If you have any questions or run into issues, please reach out to your Office 365 admin support.
