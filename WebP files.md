## History:

* On2 Technologies is a company that created the original concept of WebP. 
* Each WebP file consists of VP8 or VP8L image data. VP8 and VP8L are used to compress images and videos with higher quality.
* Google added support for animation and transparency in 2011. 
* This format is not just limited to Google-supported products, such as YouTube, Chrome, and other Google services, but now it also uses animation and transparency features in non-Google
products such as Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and other third-party applications.

## Why Use WebP Files:

* Google created the WebP file format to make online images less bulky with significantly reduced photo and graphic sizes. 
* It made the loading time faster across the internet. WebP allows websites to display high quality images but with much smaller sizes than traditional formats like PNG and JPEG.
* Lossless WebP images can be up to 26% smaller than PNGs.
* A WebP image will have a .WEBP extension, so you can easily identify if a file is a WebP.

## How to Use WebP Files:

### Reducing Website Image Sizes:

* By using predictive coding techniques, WebP files compress photos and graphics without reducing the quality of their appearance.

### Supporting Online Animations:

* GIFs, a format for memes and other basic online animations, are overhyped.
* WebP files suggest that animated WebP can be significantly smaller than a GIF, requiring fewer bytes.

## Pros and Cons of WebP Files:

### Advantages:

* Faster loading web pages.
* WebP format is highly compatible.
* WebP format frees up storage space for businesses by compressing their website images.

### Disadvantages:

* It is designed for the internet, so it might not be helpful for offline use.
* Older browsers, such as Internet Explorer, may not support WebP images effectively.
* If you work with photographers and high-quality images, a small amount of compression can reduce the quality of images.
