# Technical Project Manager Focus Walk Checklist

## Daily Tasks

### Sprint and Issue Management:
1. Log in to **Jira** and review the current sprint. Ensure only one issue is "In Progress" per team member and address any deviations.
2. For the issue **In Progress**, verify **Smart Commits** and **Smart Branches** for adherence to naming conventions and relevance to the ticket number.
3. Confirm that each issue is associated with an **Epic** for better sprint organization.
4. Review the **Time Log** for the In Progress issue to ensure daily logging. Follow up if logging is overdue.
5. Check comments on the **In Progress issue** for clear communication using the **SMART STAR** method and address any questions or blockers.

### Code and Work Quality:
6. Spot-check **pull requests** and review comments in the **Review Column** to ensure proper code review practices are followed.
7. Engage in **API verification** with developers, comparing implementation with official documentation for consistency.
8. Encourage developers to share insights from **OpenLens** about the Kubernetes cluster's health and performance.
   - Developers need to find stopping points and do a release, and we are responsible for these releases. We need to hop on a call with them and ask about the release.

### Team Coordination and Communication:
9. Touch base with each team member to discuss work quality, challenges, and team communication. Act swiftly on any concerns.
10. Discuss upcoming issues with team members to clarify requirements and add useful information to tickets.

### System Health Monitoring:
12. Use **OpenLens** to check server performance and overall system health.
13. Monitor **CI/CD Pipelines** for smooth operation and check **AWS CodeBuild** logs for errors.
